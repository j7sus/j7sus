### Hi there I'm J7SUSðŸ‘‹

I really love technology and coding, and I believe it's what motivates me to pursue a career in this field. Right now, I'm studying at 42 Barcelona to enhance my skills and gain more knowledge in this area. ðŸŒ± As student my goal is to specialize in content creation with a focus on design and development using coding and new technologies. I enjoy learning and improving my skills in these areas.

Barcelona's 42 school provides top-notch resources for technology studies, and its collaborative setting has facilitated understanding and experience, including working with others on open source software development projects.
