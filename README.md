### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have an immense love for technology and coding, which I consider as the driving force behind my career aspirations. As a result, I'm currently a student at 42 Barcelona, where I'm seeking to expand my skillset and knowledge in this field.

As student my goal is to specialize in content creation with a focus on design and development using coding and new technologies. I enjoy learning and improving my skills in these areas.

Barcelona's 42 school provides top-notch resources for technology studies, and its collaborative setting has facilitated understanding and experience, including working with others on open source software development projects.
