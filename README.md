### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have an immense love for technology and coding, which I consider as the driving force behind my career aspirations. As a result, I'm currently a student at 42 Barcelona, where I'm seeking to expand my skillset and knowledge in this field.

As student my goal is to specialize in content creation with a focus on design and development using coding and new technologies. I enjoy learning and improving my skills in these areas.

My interest in open source software and technology began early in my academic journey and has become my primary focus ever since. I am always looking for opportunities to learn more about the latest trends and developments in this sector. That is why I am currently enrolled at 42 Barcelona, a prestigious programming school that has a unique pedagogical model.

At 42 Barcelona, I have access to state-of-the-art facilities and resources that have helped me gain a fuller understanding of technology-related topics. In addition, the collaborative environment of the school has allowed me to work with other students on various projects.
